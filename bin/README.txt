Notes:
- resources folder has the text file that contains 5 letter words and an image jpg
- I created the GUI in a Java file instead of a fxml file with SceneBuilder. I understand 
	that SceneBuilder is supposed to simplify making the GUI with drag and drop features 
	but my disability makes it so that using a mouse is difficult â€” typing up code is a lot easier
	for me. I have talked about this with Prof. Lupoli. I do not have a fxml or controller file.
- i changed the alignment of the reset button after the demo. everything else is the same.
